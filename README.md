## 📚 About The Project

This is an app built in the NLW Together, made by [@Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat), to compliment your coworkers or colleagues on things they helped/inspired you.

I chose the NodeJS track because I wanted to solidify my knowledge in this technology and learn new concepts that I can apply in my projects.
